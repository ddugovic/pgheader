<h1>Header format for polyglot books.</h1>
<h2><a name=rationale>Rationale</a></h2>
The <a href=http://hardy.uhasselt.be/Toga/book_format.html>Polyglot opening book format</a> is the most widely used non-proprietary opening book format. It is understood by many chess engines as well
as by <a href=http://www.gnu.org/software/xboard/>xboard/winboard</a>, <a href=http://sourceforge.net/projects/icsdrone/>icsdrone</a> and <a href=http://ajonsson.kapsi.fi/cutechess.html>cutechess</a>.
<p>
Currently Polyglot book files do not contain any metadata. This is
problematic for many reasons
<ul>
<li>The file type cannot be reliably identified.</li>
<li>No author information can be embedded in the file.</li>
<li>No license/copyright information can be embedded in the file.</li>
<li>It is not possible to specify that the book is for a non FIDE chess variant
(such as suicide chess).</li>
</ul>    
In the current document we propose an extensible header format for
Polyglot opening books. 
To facilitate implementation we include a utility for handling such headers.
<p>
Since it is anticipated that the adoption of this header format will take
some time, we have opted for a header consisting entirely of printable
ASCII characters (with some qualification, see below). So the header can be inspected by a text editor or using
a simple dump program such as <tt>od</tt> on Linux. In particular the
following command
<p>
<tt>od -w16 -a &lt;file&gt; | less</tt>
<p> 
will display the header.
<h2><a name=backward_compatibility>A note on backward compatibility<a></h2>
The new header is backward compatible in the 
sense that it is invisible for applications that use Polyglot books
through lookup of individual keys corresponding to chess positions (e.g. chess engines). 
<p>
Applications that handle Polyglot books in a more global way (such
as the Polyglot book merging utility) which are unaware of the header could possibly
unintentionally mess it up.  But the resulting file will still
behave correctly from the point of view of key lookup.
<p>
A broken header may be easily
deleted and recreated with the <a href=../pgheader-release>pgheader</a> utility which is further
described below.
<p>
Polyglot as of version <a href=http://hardy.uhasselt.be/Toga/polyglot-release/>1.4.70b</a> is aware of the  new header and will treat it correctly.
<h2><a name=polyglot_books>Polyglot books</a></h2>
A polyglot book consists of a series of 16 byte records. The first 8 bytes of
each record form the <em>key</em>. Normally the key is the zobrist hash key
of a chess position.
There may be more than one record with the same key.
The records are ordered 
according to their keys (lowest key first).

Records with a <em> null key</em> <tt>0x0000000000000000</tt> will be called <em>null records</em> below. If they exist they must necessarily be at the beginning of the file.
<p>
The header data will be embedded in null records. Chess positions
that correspond to null keys are actually known (they were constructed
by Peter &Ouml;sterlund) but the probability that such a position would
occur in an actual chess game is totally negligeable, and moreover
the probability of a collision with another key in the book is much larger.
Of course
a header aware application may simply regard a null key as invalid.
<h2><a name=header_data>Header data</a></h2>
In a polyglot book the <em>header data</em> is defined as the concatenation
of the non-key data in the null records. The bytes in the header
data are in the same order as in the file.
<p>
<b>If there are no null records then the book is assumed to contain no header.</b>
<h2><a name=logical_header>The logical header</a></h2>
The <em>logical header</em> is the part up to and including the first null character in the header data. 

<p>

<b>If there is no null character in the header data then the book is assumed to contain no header.</b>

<p>

The logical header is a <em>UTF-8 encoded unicode character string</em>  (without byte order marker, see below). Note
that a character string consisting of 7 bit ascii characters is a valid
UTF-8 string.

<p>

As the logical header may be arbitrarily long this may present problems
for applications that use fixed length buffers. 

<p>

<b>An application may refuse to parse a header which it considers too long. However it should always be able to process a logical header
of at most 2048 characters (including the null character).</b>


<h2><a name=fields>Fields</a></h2>
The logical header is considered to be a sequence of <em>fields</em> separated
by linefeed characters <tt>0x0A</tt>. The linefeed characters are not 
part of the fields.  The carriage return character <tt>0x0D</tt> is <em>not</em> a field
separator, even if it occurs together with a linefeed in the
typical newline sequence "\r\n". Note that Windows has 
the habit of changing "\n" into "\r\n" behind your back, so please test
on that platform.

<p>

A certain number of fields (depending on
the format version) are predefined. The predefined fields should
not contain leading or trailing spaces. Numbers are written in decimal form
without leading zeros.

<p>

The definition of the first three fields is independent
of the format version.
<ul>
<li> The first field should always be equal to <tt>@PG@</tt>.</li>
<li> The second field is the version number. It has the format
<p>
<tt> &lt;major&gt;.&lt;minor&gt;</tt>
<p>
where <tt>&lt;major&gt;</tt> and <tt>&lt;minor&gt;</tt> are respectively
the major and minor version number written in decimal form. They
should be non-negative integers and contain no leading zeros.
<p>
<li>The third field is the total number of predefined fields (not
including the first three). If <tt>m</tt> is the number
of predefined fields then the first comment field will be 
numbered <tt>4+m</tt>. Applications <b>should</b> skip predefined fields
they do not know about (that is: if these fields belong to a higher header version
than the one they are currently supporting). 
</ul>
In the current version of the logical header (1.0) one has:
<ul>
<li>The fourth field is the number of variants supported by the book.</li>
</ul>
If <tt>n</tt> is the number of variants in the book then the fields <tt>5</tt> to <tt>5+n-1</tt>
are the names of the variants supported by the book. 
<p>
Variant names should be printable ascii characters and contain no spaces
or upper case letters.
<b>For known variants  the standard variant
names from the <a href=http://www.gnu.org/software/xboard/engine-intf.html>Chess Engine Communication Protocol</a> should be used.</b>
<p>
Having zero variants is legal but the meaning of this is undefined in v1.0
of the format.
<p>
The non-predefined fields are free format. They should be regarded
as comments and would typically include license information, author data, 
source files etc...
<h2><a name=extensibility>A note on extensibility</a></h2>
It recommended that newer versions of the format do not change the definition
of predefined fields. Instead it is recommended to add new fields. The
design of the format allows one to do this is in a way which is
invisible to applications supporting only an earlier version of the
format.

<p>

Currently the logical header is structured like a shallow tree. It
is recommended to keep this tree-like format for further
versions of the format according to the following Backus-Naur form

<pre>
&lt;header&gt;        := &lt;magic&gt;\n&lt;version&gt;\n&lt;root-field&gt;[\n&lt;field&gt;]*
&lt;magic&gt;         := @PG@
&lt;version&gt;       := &lt;number&gt;.&lt;number&gt;
&lt;root-field&gt;    := &lt;count&gt;[\n&lt;multi-field&gt;]*
&lt;multi-field&gt;   := [&lt;root-field&gt; | &lt;field&gt;]
&lt;field&gt;         := &lt;string&gt; 
&lt;count&gt;         := &lt;number&gt;
</pre>
where &lt;string&gt; is assumed to contain no linefeed characters and
&lt;count&gt; is the total number of fields contained in the corresponding
subtree (but not including the &lt;count&gt; field itself).

<h2><a name=note_utf-8>A note on UTF-8</a></h2> Although this specification allows the
comment section in the header to contain UTF-8 encoded multi-byte
characters (recognizable by the fact that the highest bit in the
corresponding bytes is set) it is currently probably best for a widely
distributed book to use only the backward compatible 7bit ascii subset
of UTF-8 (i.e. only single byte characters).

Indeed not all current GUI's may be prepared to display multi-byte
characters although this is likely to change in the future.

<p>

For clarification it should also be pointed out that the header should
<b>not</b> contain a byte order marker (BOM) since it breaks compatibility
with 7bit ascii. But this
issue is actually moot since a valid BOM would be at the beginning of the header
where normally the magic string is. So a header containing a BOM would
be invalid.

<p> A BOM is not necessary since by design UTF-8 has no endianness ambiguity
and moreover  the official specification for UTF-8 specifies a BOM as optional.

<h2><a name=example>Example</a></h2>
The following logical header (written as C string) represents a book supporting
normal and suicide chess.
<p>
<tt>
"@PG@\n1.0\n3\n2\nnormal\nsuicide\n(normally comments here)"
</tt>
<p>
In version 1.1 of the format it might perhaps be
<p>
<tt>
"@PG@\n1.1\n4\n2\nnormal\nsuicide\n[somenewfield]\n(normally comments here)"
</tt>
<p>
<h2><a name=sample_code>Sample code</a></h2>
Here is <a href=../pgheader-release>
sample code</a> that adds, displays and deletes headers in Polyglot books.
This code may be freely used in guis, adaptors and other programs (including
closed source ones).  
<p>

<pre>
$ ./pgheader -h
pgheader &lt;options&gt; [&lt;file&gt];
Update a header, adding a default one if necessary
&lt;file&gt;            input file
Options:
-h                print this help 
-l                print the known variant list
-s                print the header
-S                print the header data
-d                delete the header
-v  &lt;variants&gt;    comma separated list of supported variants
-f                force inclusion of unknown variants
-c  &lt;comment&gt;     free format string, may contain newlines encoded as
                  two character strings "\n"
</pre>
The following command adds a comment to the very widely used polyglot
book "performance.bin" by Marc Lacrosse.
<pre>
$ ./pgheader performance.bin  -c "performance.bin by Marc Lacrosse."
</pre>
We verify that the header has indeed been added.
<pre>
$ ./pgheader -s performance.bin
Variants supported:
normal
Comment:
performance.bin by Marc Lacrosse.
</pre>
Here is the actual header data as shown by "./pgheader -S performance.bin".
<pre>
    @    P    G    @   \n    1    .    0
   \n    2   \n    1   \n    n    o    r
    m    a    l   \n    p    e    r    f
    o    r    m    a    n    c    e    .
    b    i    n         b    y         M
    a    r    c         L    a    c    r
    o    s    s    e    .   \0   \0   \0
</pre>
The actual api is contained in the source files <tt>pgheader.h</tt>
and <tt>pgheader.c</tt>. It provides the following functions 
<pre>
int pgheader_known_variant(const char *variant);
int pgheader_detect(const char *infile);
int pgheader_create(char **header, const char *variants, const char *comment);
int pgheader_create_raw(char **raw_header, const char *header, unsigned int *size);
int pgheader_parse(const char *header, char **variants, char **comment);
int pgheader_read(char **header, const char *infile);
int pgheader_read_raw(char **raw_header, const char *infile, unsigned int *size);
int pgheader_write(const char *header, const char *infile, const char *outfile);
int pgheader_delete(const char *infile, const char *outfile);
const char * pgheader_strerror(int pgerror);
</pre>
For instructions about using these functions see the comments in <tt>pgheader.h</tt>.


<h2><a name=magics>Magics</a></h2>
The following magic may be used to recognize the new header on Linux
