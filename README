NAME
       pgheader - A utility to manipulate headers of Polyglot opening books.

SYNPOPSIS
       pgheader <options> [<file>]

DESCRIPTION
       pgheader is a utility to manipulate headers of Polyglot opening books.
       The Polyglot format is the defacto standard non-proprietary opening
       book format.  It is fully documented here

       http://hardy.uhasselt.be/Toga/book_format.html

       Historically Polyglot book files did not contain any metadata which is
       problematic for many reasons. Recently a backward compatible and
       extensible standard has emerged to add such metadata to Polyglot books.
       This standard is described here.

       http://hardy.uhasselt.be/Toga/pgheader-release/header.html

       pgheader implements v1.0 of this standard. In v1.0 the metadata
       consists of a list of variants supported by the book in addition to a
       comment section which typically includes license information, author
       data, source files etc...

       pgheader accepts the following options.

       -h  Print help.

       -l  Print the list of known variants.

       -s  Print the header.

       -S  Print the header data. This works even if the logical header is
           broken.

       -d  Delete the header.

       -v  This is a comma separated list of supported variants. The variant
           list in the book will be replaced by the supplied list.

       -f  Force the inclusion of unknown variants.

       -c  This is a free format string which may contain newlines encoded as
           two character strings "\n". The comment section will be replaced by
           the supplied string.
